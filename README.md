# SBOL Visual CSS

SBOL Visual CSS (see [full documentation online](http://edinburgh-genome-foundry.github.io/SBOL-visual-css/) or in index.html)
is a pure-CSS library to easily display schematic DNA sequences in the Visual SBOL standard using a simple HTML syntax:

```
<div class="sbol-visual centered">
    <div class="sbolv promoter">p1</div>
    <div class="sbolv cds">lac</div>
    <div class="sbolv terminator">terminator</div>
</div>
```

While very light, SBOL Visual CSS is has features such as inline SBOL and
combinatorial assemblies, and is versatile enough to serve
as a generic SBOL visualizer for databases, web articles, etc.
It is distributed as a [self-contained CSS file]() (20kb) and
is therefore fit for embedding into HTML emails.


SBOL-visual CSS was originally written at the [Edinburgh Genome Foundry](http://genomefoundry.org/)"> by [Zulko](https://github.com/Zulko).
The code is released on [Github](https://github.com/Edinburgh-Genome-Foundry/SBOL-Visual-CSS) under the MIT Licence (Copyright Edinburgh Genome Foundry), everyone is welcome to contribute.
